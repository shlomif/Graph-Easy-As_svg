  * require Graph::Easy v0.62

2006-09-03 v0.20 Tels 89 tests
  * require Graph::Easy v0.47
  * fix invalid output on multi-line aligned labels
  * fix alignment of labels on loops and vertical edges (text-align takes

    using \r, \l or \c instead of \n
  * fix warning and missing arrows when using edge { arrow-style: open; }

  * close the gaps on edges with style double
  * fix the fontsize (was missing a "px") and also use 16 as the base vs. 14
    This makes the text independed from the user setting in the browser, and
    also increases it to be more readable.
  * always include the fill, to help renderers that can't cope with CSS styles
  * fix rendering of multiline labels:
    + lineheight is 18px vs 1em to not have the lines drawn together
    + no longer contain a spurious empty last <tspan>-pair

  * a Node::Empty should not be rendered
  * font is really font-family in CSS section
  * support point-shaped nodes with point-style: invisible

    + invisible edges
    + nodes with "shape: img" (Thanx to Jeff Schiller for pointing out

  * add an onclick-handler to links to force them to open in the current
    window/tab - work around bug in FF 1.5 (Thanx Jeff Schiller again!)
  * put the link around the node shape, not just the text. Makes it easier
    to hit the link.
  * nodes with shape: point get a link, too (although the area is tiny)

2006-01-01 v0.16 Tels 72 tests
  * require Graph::Easy v0.38

  * fix edge crossings with different widths (wide vs. broad etc)
  * add rendering of edge joints

2005-12-10 v0.14 Tels 72 tests

  * support bold-dash, broad and wide edge/border styles
  * correct node-sizes to accomodate border-width
  * shorten edge-pieces with labels a bit
  * implement a crude version of _text_length(), returning the text length
    in pixels depending on EM and the string content ("WW" vs. "ii"). This
    stops nodes from being overly broad with lots of padding.
  * don't generate invalid SVG on labels/node names with "--", "&", "<" or ">"
  * limit precision on edge-lines and arrows to 2 digits (instead of 4)

  * the "autolink" and "link" attributes correctly create links with
    mouseover titles
  * nodes with shape "none" result no longer in invalid SVG
  * only include the actually used defitinons, that shortens the output,
    especially for small graphs
  * don't need to output "stroke-width" for including arrow heads, this
    shortens the output a bit
  * shorten output by grouping multiple lines of an edge together
  * text in (invert)-triangle etc nodes is better displaced to fit better
  * better rendering of multi-line labels on edges
